          General Work Terms and Client Responsibilities & Liabilities
        </h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          The client shall be solely responsible for providing all site content,
          including text and multimedia, to Seven Unique Tech Solutions Pvt.
          Ltd. before work begins. By engaging with Seven Unique Tech Solutions
          Pvt. Ltd., the user confirms that they have read, understood, and
          accepted the Privacy Policy of Seven Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
          The user also agrees to receive SMS and email notifications on their
          registered mobile number. Additionally, the client is responsible for
          creating proper backups of all website content before allowing Seven
          Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. to proceed with the agreed tasks. The
          company will not be held liable for any loss or damage to existing
          data under any circumstances.
          <br />
          <br />
          The contract does not hold Seven Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
          responsible for tasks related to data entry, web hosting, or custom
          artwork/graphics unless explicitly specified, agreed upon, and paid by
          both parties. Any artwork, images, or text provided or created by
          Seven Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. for the client will remain the
          property of the company and/or its suppliers unless otherwise agreed
          upon in writing.
          <br />
          <br />
          Seven Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. strives to meet all delivery
          timelines; however, there may be instances where extensions or
          adjustments are necessary due to unforeseen and unavoidable
          circumstances. These may include deployment challenges, dependencies,
          third-party support delays, development bottlenecks, resource
          unavailability due to emergencies, communication delays, or similar
          issues. The company will make every effort to address these challenges
          promptly and minimize any impact on delivery schedules.
          <br />
          <br />
          Seven Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. will provide the Client with an
          opportunity to review the website's design and content during the
          development process and after completion. The company will wait a
          period of 7 days to receive feedback on the shared work or outputs. If
          the Client does not respond within this timeframe, the material will
          be considered automatically accepted and approved. The Client retains
          copyright ownership of any data, files, or graphic logos provided and
          grants Seven Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. the rights to publish and
          use such materials. It is the Client's responsibility to obtain the
          necessary permissions and rights for any third-party copyrighted
          information or files used in the project. Additionally, the Client
          agrees to provide Seven Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. with the
          rights to use such materials and indemnify the company against any
          claims arising from the Client's failure to secure proper copyright
          permissions. A contract for website design and/or placement serves as
          the Client's assurance to Seven Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. that
          all required permissions and authorizations have been obtained.
          <br />
          <br />
          Evidence of permissions and authorizations may be requested. Seven
          Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. will not be held responsible for any
          changes made to the Client's pages or website by the Client or any
          third party after deployment. These changes may include, but are not
          limited to, additions, modifications, or deletions. The company may
          charge a one-time Web Development fee to address and resolve any
          issues arising from such alterations.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Payments</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Seven Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. accepts payments via cheque,
          cash, or bank transfers, though the company reserves the right to
          refuse any payment method without prior notice. Additionally, Seven
          Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. retains the right to withdraw accepted
          payment methods or adjust pricing at any time without notice. If the
          Customer cancels the service before its completion, a cancellation fee
          may apply, equivalent to the value of the work completed up to the
          cancellation point. Failure to pay the cancellation fee or settle
          overdue amounts may result in legal action if necessary.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Support and Third Party</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Upon site launch, we provide free support for the first month. After
          this period, support services are charged based on various pricing
          packages tailored to the client's needs, with attractive discounts
          available for higher-tier packages. The scope of support includes bug
          fixes and email support but excludes issues related to site
          architecture, rule changes, and add-ons or enhancements. Any
          third-party products, services, or integrations requiring licensing,
          payments, or copyright compliance will be the sole responsibility of
          the client. Alternatively, Seven Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. can
          procure them on the client's behalf, subject to pre-payment for
          associated costs. Fees charged by Seven Unique Tech Solutions Pvt.
          Ltd. do not include out-of-pocket expenses or claims from third-party
          products or services. The company does not guarantee or warrant the
          accuracy or performance of any third-party product or service.
          Additionally, any upgrades or modifications to third-party products or
          services used in the project may require a feasibility review and
          potential adjustments to pricing and timelines.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">
          Re-work, Enhancements/Add-ons and Billing
        </h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Any additional features not included in the agreed scope of work will
          be addressed through a Change Management process and billed
          separately. Scope changes occurring after wireframe approval will also
          incur additional charges, with corresponding adjustments to timelines
          and costs. While minor tweaks or reworks are typically accommodated,
          repeated or excessive requests may be deemed abusive. In such cases, a
          list of the work involved will be compiled, and additional charges
          will apply based on the time and effort required, ranging from $15 to
          $20 per hour. Although we strive to include most changes within the
          project budget, certain requests may be classified as enhancements or
          add-ons and will be chargeable. Clients will be informed of such costs
          before work begins. Any rework, changes, or tweaks requested after
          approval or subsequent project stages will also be treated as
          additional work and billed accordingly. The client agrees to pay all
          fees charged by Seven Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. in full, without
          deductions, discounts, or offsets, by the agreed due dates.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Approvals and Delivery</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          The project will progress through various stages, with work on the
          next stage commencing only after receiving approval and the agreed
          payments for the previous stage. Upon completion of the service
          (website design and/or development), the website will be uploaded to
          Seven Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd.'s server for the Client's review
          and approval. Once approved, the website will be uploaded to the final
          destination server. Seven Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. reserves the
          right to delay the final upload until full payment has been received.
          All code and materials developed during the project will be
          transferred to the Client upon project completion and after the
          necessary approvals. Ownership of the code will reside with the Client
          after final payments are made. Seven Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
          retains the right to showcase the completed work and/or deployed
          website as a reference for potential clients. If the Client wishes to
          restrict this, they must notify Seven Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
          in advance and obtain prior approval for such a request.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Limitations of Liability</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Seven Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. will exercise reasonable skill
          and care in providing its services. However, the company makes no
          guarantees and disclaims all express or implied warranties regarding
          the availability, quality, accuracy, timeliness, completeness,
          performance, or fitness of the services provided. Seven Unique Tech
          Solutions Pvt. Ltd., including its employees and agents, accepts no
          liability for any loss or damage caused by inaccuracies, omissions,
          delays, or errors in the website's production, whether due to
          negligence or other reasons. Furthermore, the company is not
          responsible for any loss or damage to the Client's artwork, photos,
          data, or content supplied for the website, regardless of the cause.
          Except in cases of death or personal injury caused by the company's
          negligence, Seven Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. will not be liable
          for any damages arising from or in connection with this agreement or
          the operation of the services, whether in contract, tort, or
          otherwise. The company will not be responsible for any direct,
          indirect, or consequential damages, including loss of profit, property
          damage, or third-party claims. Additionally, Seven Unique Tech
          Solutions Pvt. Ltd. does not guarantee services provided by
          third-party organizations and will not be held liable for any failures
          or issues related to third-party services.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Timescale</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Seven Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd. will make every effort to
          complete all services within the agreed-upon timescale. The project
          timeline will begin once the agreed deposit (ranging from 30% to 50%
          of the project price, as mutually discussed and agreed upon before
          contract finalization) and all required website content from the
          Customer are received. However, Seven Unique Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
          may need to extend the timescale if circumstances beyond its control
          arise.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
          applicable laws, and any disputes arising from or relating to these
          Terms and Conditions shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
          the relevant authorities. By placing an order, the Customer confirms
          acceptance of these terms, which are attached to the Order.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Severability</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed pb-10">
          If any provision of this Agreement and/or Order is found to be
          invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will
          remain unaffected, and the Agreement and/or Order will not be void for
          this reason alone. The invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision
          will be replaced with a mutually acceptable, valid, legal, and
          enforceable provision that closely reflects the original intent of the
          parties.
